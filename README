This is a bunch of programs for demonstrating basic programming, with a machine code like language. The language is not intended to be general purpose, but only to operate on "decks of cards" (essentially stacks of integers) to demonstrate sorting algorithms and simpler rearranging tasks. There are both an interpreter and a compiler/VM pair. It's all written in Scala, but using primarily very elementary constructs, i.e., by design the code does not take advantage of many of the elegant constructs of scala. The intention is that someone with very limited knowledge of programming constructs should be able to read most of the code.
